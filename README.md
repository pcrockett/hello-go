## Hello World

My first real foray into Go.

### Getting Started

Install Go. Then run `./tudas`.

### TODO

* [x] Use `log` package from https://go.dev/doc/tutorial/handle-errors
* [x] Refactor greetings package to return a greeting struct with both hello and goodbye
* [ ] Public / private methods
* [ ] Use interfaces for polymorphism
* [ ] Define custom greeting
* [ ] Parse command line parameters
